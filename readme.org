* Show Me
Simple home camera / monitoring app
* Setup
Setup venv if needed (i.e. python3 -m venv venv) then:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

Customize .env as needed
* Running the app
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
#+END_SRC
--host flag will allow the app to bind on any ip, which allows any device to connect to the app

Go to localhost:5000

To run it in systemd, edit showme.service (WorkingDirectory and ExecStart specifically)
Copy it to /etc/systemd/system/
then start/enable the service
* Security
Do NOT use this app in production!
It is only built as proof of concept.
There is no security measures in place.

Notably:
- This app cannot tell who or how many devices are connected and streaming (TODO)
- Related to above point, authentication and authorization is not implemented (TODO)
- Flask is a wrapper around Werkzeug which allows access to console as debug tool
  - It can potentially allow RCE
